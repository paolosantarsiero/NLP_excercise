      " machine ethics artificial moral agents friendly AI and discussion towards building a human rights framework is also in talks Joseph Weizenbaum in Computer Power and Human Reason wrote that AI applications cannot by definition successfully simulate genuine human empathy and that the use of AI technology in fields such as customer service or psychotherapy j was deeply misguided Weizenbaum was also bothered that AI researchers and some philosophers were willing to view the human mind as nothing more than a computer program a position now known as computationalism To Weizenbaum these points suggest that AI research devalues human life Wendell Wallach introduced the concept of artificial moral agents AMA in his book Moral Machines For Wallach AMAs have become a part of the research landscape of artificial intelligence as guided by its two central questions which he identifies as Does Humanity Want Computers Making Moral Decisions and Can Ro bots Really Be Moral For Wallach the question is not centered on the issue of whether machines can demonstrate the equivalent of moral behavior unlike the constraints which society may place on the development of AMAs The field of machine ethics is concerned with giving machines ethical principles or a procedure for discovering a way to resolve the ethical dilemmas they might encounter enabling them to function in an ethically responsible manner through their own ethical decision making The field was delineated in the AAAI Fall Symposium on Machine Ethics Past research concerning the relationship between technology and ethics has largely focused on responsible and irresponsible use of technology by human beings with a few people being interested in how human beings ought to treat machines In all cases only human beings have engaged in ethical reasoning The time has come for adding an ethical dimension to at least some machines Recognition of the ethical ramifications of behavior involving machines as well as recent and potential developments in machine autonomy necessitate this In contrast to computer hacking software property issues privacy issues and other topics normally ascribed to computer ethics machine ethics is concerned with the behavior of machines towards human users and other machines Research in machine ethics is key to alleviating concerns with autonomous systems it could be argued that the notion of autonomous machines without such a dimension is at the root of all fear concerning machine intelligence Further investigation of machine ethics could enable the discovery of problems with current ethical theories advancing our thinking about Ethics Machine ethics is sometimes referred to as machine morality computational ethics or computational morality A variety of perspectives of this nascent field can be found in the collected edition Machine Ethics that stems from the AAAI Fall Symposium on Machine Ethics Political scientist Charles T Rubin believes that AI can be neither designed nor guaranteed to be benevolent He argues that any sufficiently advanced benevolence may be indistinguishable from malevolence Humans should not assume machines or robots would treat us favorably because there is no a priori reason to believe that they would be sympathetic to our system of morality which has evolved along with our particular biology which AIs would not share Hyper intelligent software may not necessarily decide to support the continued existence of humanity and would be extremely difficult to stop This topic has also recently begun to be discussed in academic publications as a real source of risks to civilization humans and planet Earth One proposal to deal with this is to ensure that the first generally intelligent AI is Friendly AI and will be able to control subsequently developed AIs Some question whether this kind of check could actually remain in place Leading AI researcher Rodney Brooks writes I think it is a mistake to be worrying about us developing malevolent AI anytime in the next few hundred years I think the worry stems from a fundamental error in not distinguishing the difference between the very real recent advances in a particular aspect of AI and the enormity and complexity of building sentient volitional intelligence Lethal autonomous weapons are of concern Currently countries are researching battlefield robots including the United States China Russia and the United Kingdom Many people concerned about risk from superintelligent AI also want to limit the use of artificial soldiers and drones If an AI system replicates all key aspects of human intelligence will that system also be sentient will it have a mind which has conscious experiences This question is closely related to the philosophical problem as to the nature of human consciousness generally referred to as the hard problem of consciousness David Chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind which he named the hard and easy problems of consciousness The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals makes plans and controls behavior The hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all Human information processing is easy to explain however human subjective experience is difficult to explain For example consider what happens when a person is shown a color swatch and identifies it saying it s red The easy problem only requires understanding the machinery in the brain that makes it possible for a person to know that the color swatch is red The hard problem is that people also know something else they also know what red looks like Consider that a person born blind can know that something is red without knowing what red looks like k Everyone knows subjective experience exists because they do it every day e g all sighted people know what red looks like The hard problem is explaining how the brain creates it why it exists and how it is different from knowledge and other aspects of the brain Computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind or the human brain or both is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind body problem This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam The philosophical position that John Searle has named strong AI states The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds l Searle counters this assertion with his Chinese room argument which asks us to look inside the computer and try to find where the mind might be If a machine can be created that has intelligence could it also feel If it can feel does it have the same rights as a human This issue now known as robot rights is currently being considered by for example California s Institute for the Future although many critics believe that the discussion is premature Some critics of transhumanism argue that any hypothetical robot rights would lie on a spectrum with animal rights and human rights The subject is profoundly discussed in the documentary film Plug Pray and many sci fi media such as Star Trek Next Generation with the character of Commander Data who fought being disassembled for research and wanted to become human and the robotic holograms in Voyager Are there limits to how intelligent machines or human machine hybrids can be A superintelligence hyperintelligence or superhuman intelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind Superintelligence may also refer to the form or degree of intelligence possessed by such an agent If research into Strong AI produced sufficiently intelligent software it might be able to reprogram and improve itself The improved software would be even better at improving itself leading to recursive self improvement The new intelligence could thus increase exponentially and dramatically surpass humans Science fiction writer Vernor Vinge named this scenario singularity Technological singularity is when accelerating progress in technologies will cause a runaway effect wherein artificial intelligence will exceed human intellectual capacity and control thus radically changing or even ending civilization Because the capabilities of such an intelligence may be impossible to comprehend the technological singularity is an occurrence beyond which events are unpredictable or even unfathomable Ray Kurzweil has used Moore s law which describes the relentless exponential improvement in digital technology to calculate that desktop computers will have the same processing power as human brains by the year and predicts that the singularity will occur in Robot designer Hans Moravec cyberneticist Kevin Warwick and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either This idea called transhumanism has roots in Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger Edward Fredkin argues that artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution an idea first proposed by Samuel Butler s Darwin among the Machines as far back as and expanded upon by George Dyson in his book of the same name in The long term economic effects of AI are uncertain A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long term unemployment but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers sees the People s Republic of China gaining economically the most out of AI with of GDP until A February European Union white paper on artificial intelligence advocated for artificial intelligence for economic benefits including improving healthcare e g making diagnosis more precise enabling better prevention of diseases increasing the efficiency of farming contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation and improving the efficiency of production systems through predictive maintenance while acknowledging potential risks The relationship between automation and employment is complicated While automation eliminates old jobs it also creates new jobs through micro economic and macro economic effects Unlike previous waves of automation many middle class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence The Economist states that the worry that AI could do to white collar jobs what steam power did to blue collar ones during the Industrial Revolution is worth taking seriously Subjective estimates of the risk vary widely for example Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey estimate of U S jobs are at high risk of potential automation while an OECD report classifies only of U S jobs as high risk Jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks while job demand is likely to increase for care related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy Author Martin Ford and others go further and argue that many jobs are routine repetitive and to an AI predictable Ford warns that these jobs may be automated in the next couple of decades and that many of the new jobs may not be accessible to people with average capability even with retraining Economists point out that in the past technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment but acknowledge that we re in uncharted territory with AI The potential negative effects of AI and automation were a major issue for Andrew Yang s presidential campaign in the United States Irakli Beridze Head of the Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics at UNICRI United Nations has expressed that I think the dangerous applications for AI from my point of view would be criminals or large terrorist organizations using it to disrupt large processes or simply do pure harm Terrorists could cause harm via digital warfare or it could be a combination of robotics drones with AI and other things as well that could be really dangerous And of course other risks come from things like job losses If we have massive numbers of people losing jobs and don t find a solution it will be extremely dangerous Things like lethal autonomous weapons systems should be properly governed otherwise there s massive potential of misuse Widespread use of artificial intelligence could have unintended consequences that are dangerous or undesirable Scientists from the Future of Life Institute among others described some short term research goals to see how AI influences the economy the laws and ethics that are involved with AI and how to minimize AI security risks In the long term the scientists have proposed to continue optimizing function while minimizing possible security risks that come along with new technologies Some are concerned about algorithmic bias that AI programs may unintentionally become biased after processing data that exhibits bias Algorithms already have numerous applications in legal systems An example of this is COMPAS a commercial program widely used by U S courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist ProPublica claims that the average COMPAS assigned recidivism risk level of black defendants is significantly higher than the average COMPAS assigned risk level of white defendants Physicist Stephen Hawking Microsoft founder Bill Gates history professor Yuval Noah Harari and SpaceX founder Elon Musk have expressed concerns about the possibility that AI could evolve to the point that humans could not control it with Hawking theorizing that this could spell the end of the human race The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race Once humans develop artificial intelligence it will take off on its own and redesign itself at an ever increasing rate Humans who are limited by slow biological evolution couldn t compete and would be superseded In his book Superintelligence philosopher Nick Bostrom provides an argument that artificial intelligence will pose a threat to humankind He argues that sufficiently intelligent AI if it chooses actions based on achieving some goal will exhibit convergent behavior such as acquiring resources or protecting itself from being shut down If this AI s goals do not fully reflect humanity s one example is an AI told to compute as many digits of pi as possible it might harm humanity in order to acquire more resources or prevent itself from being shut down ultimately to better achieve its goal Bostrom also emphasizes the difficulty of fully conveying humanity s values to an advanced AI He uses the hypothetical example of giving an AI the goal to make humans smile to illustrate a misguided attempt If the AI in that scenario were to become superintelligent Bostrom argues it may resort to methods that most humans would find horrifying such as inserting electrodes into the facial muscles of humans to cause constant beaming grins because that would be an efficient way to achieve its goal of making humans smile In his book Human Compatible AI researcher Stuart J Russell echoes some of Bostrom s concerns while also proposing an approach to developing provably beneficial machines focused on uncertainty and deference to humans possibly involving inverse reinforcement learning Concern over risk from artificial intelligence has led to some high profile donations and investments A group of prominent tech titans including Peter Thiel Amazon Web Services and Musk have committed billion to OpenAI a nonprofit company aimed at championing responsible AI development The opinion of experts within the field of artificial intelligence is mixed with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superhumanly capable AI Other technology industry leaders believe that artificial intelligence is helpful in its current form and will continue to assist humans Oracle CEO Mark Hurd has stated that AI will actually create more jobs not less jobs as humans will be needed to manage AI systems Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes AI will unlock a huge amount of positive things such as curing disease and increasing the safety of autonomous cars In January Musk donated million to the Future of Life Institute to fund research on understanding AI decision making The goal of the institute is to grow wisdom with which we manage the growing power of technology Musk also funds companies developing artificial intelligence such as DeepMind and Vicarious to just keep an eye on what s going on with artificial intelligence I think there is potentially a dangerous outcome there For the danger of uncontrolled advanced AI to be realized the hypothetical AI would have to overpower or out think all of humanity which a minority of experts argue is a possibility far enough in the future to not be worth researching Other counterarguments revolve around humans being either intrinsically or convergently valuable from the perspective of an artificial intelligence The regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating artificial intelligence AI it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally including in the European Union Regulation is considered necessary to both encourage AI and manage associated risks Regulation of AI through mechanisms such as review boards can also be seen as social means to approach the AI control problem Thought capable artificial beings appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity and have been a persistent theme in science fiction A common trope in these works began with Mary Shelley s Frankenstein where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters This includes such works as Arthur C Clarke s and Stanley Kubrick s A Space Odyssey both with HAL the murderous computer in charge of the Discovery One spaceship as well as The Terminator and The Matrix In contrast the rare loyal robots such as Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still and Bishop from Aliens are less prominent in popular culture Isaac Asimov introduced the Three Laws of Robotics in many books and stories most notably the Multivac series about a super intelligent computer of the same name Asimov s laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov s laws through popular culture they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons one of which is their ambiguity Transhumanism the merging of humans and machines is explored in the manga Ghost in the Shell and the science fiction series Dune In the s artist Hajime Sorayama s Sexy Robots series were painted and published in Japan depicting the actual organic human form with lifelike muscular metallic skins and later the Gynoids book followed that was used by or influenced movie makers including George Lucas and other creatives Sorayama never considered these organic robots to be real part of nature but always an unnatural product of the human mind a fantasy existing in the mind even when realized in actual form Several works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel and thus to suffer This appears in Karel apek s R U R the films A I Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina as well as the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep by Philip K Dick Dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence See also Logic machines in fiction and List of fictional computers \n"

      "features like an artificial brain or simulated child development may someday reach a critical point where general intelligence emerges.\nThe field of machine ethics is concerned with giving machines ethical principles, or a procedure for discovering a way to resolve the ethical dilemmas they might encounter, enabling them to function in an ethically responsible manner through their own ethical decision making.\nA survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-term unemployment, but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit, if productivity gains are redistributed.\nThe subject is profoundly discussed in the 2010 documentary film Plug & Pray, and many sci fi media such as Star Trek Next Generation, with the character of Commander Data, who fought being disassembled for research, and wanted to \"become human\", and the robotic holograms in Voyager.\nTechnological singularity is when accelerating progress in technologies will cause a runaway effect wherein artificial intelligence will exceed human intellectual capacity and control, thus radically changing or even ending civilization.\nIn his book Human Compatible, AI researcher Stuart J. Russell echoes some of Bostrom's concerns while also proposing an approach to developing provably beneficial machines focused on uncertainty and deference to humans, :173 possibly involving inverse reinforcement learning.\nMany researchers predict that such \"narrow AI\" work in different individual domains will eventually be incorporated into a machine with artificial general intelligence (AGI), combining most of the narrow skills mentioned in this article and at some point even exceeding human ability in most or all these areas.\nAuthor Martin Ford and others go further and argue that many jobs are routine, repetitive and (to an AI) predictable; Ford warns that these jobs may be automated in the next couple of decades, and that many of the new jobs may not be \"accessible to people with average capability\", even with retraining.\nSome of the \"learners\" described below, including Bayesian networks, decision trees, and nearest-neighbor, could theoretically, (given infinite data, time, and memory) learn to approximate any function, including which combination of mathematical functions would best describe the world.\nRay Kurzweil has used Moore's law (which describes the relentless exponential improvement in digital technology) to calculate that desktop computers will have the same processing power as human brains by the year 2029 and predicts that the singularity will occur in 2045.\nThe success was due to increasing computational power (see Moore's law and transistor count), greater emphasis on solving specific problems, new ties between AI and other fields (such as statistics, economics and mathematics), and a commitment by researchers to mathematical methods and scientific standards.\nThe most general ontologies are called upper ontologies, which attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge by acting as mediators between domain ontologies that cover specific knowledge about a particular knowledge domain (field of interest or area of concern).\nmaking diagnosis more precise, enabling better prevention of diseases), increasing the efficiency of farming, contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation, [and] improving the efficiency of production systems through predictive maintenance\", while acknowledging potential risks.\nJoseph Weizenbaum in Computer Power and Human Reason wrote that AI applications cannot, by definition, successfully simulate genuine human empathy and that the use of AI technology in fields such as customer service or psychotherapy[j] was deeply misguided.\nThe field of AI research was born at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956, where the term \"Artificial Intelligence\" was coined by John McCarthy to distinguish the field from cybernetics and escape the influence of the cyberneticist Norbert Wiener.\nA sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would enable natural-language user interfaces and the acquisition of knowledge directly from human-written sources, such as newswire texts.\nThe increased successes with real-world data led to increasing emphasis on comparing different approaches against shared test data to see which approach performed best in a broader context than that provided by idiosyncratic toy models; AI research was becoming more scientific.\nUnlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; The Economist states that \"the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution\" is \"worth taking seriously\".\nSuch formal knowledge representations can be used in content-based indexing and retrieval, scene interpretation, clinical decision support, knowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large databases), and other areas.\n[h] Compared with GOFAI, new \"statistical learning\" techniques such as HMM and neural networks were gaining higher levels of accuracy in many practical domains such as data mining, without necessarily acquiring a semantic understanding of the datasets.\nHumans should not assume machines or robots would treat us favorably because there is no a priori reason to believe that they would be sympathetic to our system of morality, which has evolved along with our particular biology (which AIs would not share).\nThere are three philosophical questions related to AI: Machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to prevent harm and minimize the risks; they may have the ability to use ethical reasoning to better choose their actions in the world.\nFor the danger of uncontrolled advanced AI to be realized, the hypothetical AI would have to overpower or out-think all of humanity, which a minority of experts argue is a possibility far enough in the future to not be worth researching.\nTherefore, according to Occam's razor principle, a learner must be designed such that it prefers simpler theories to complex theories, except in cases where the complex theory is proven substantially better.\nProgress slowed and in 1974, in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to fund more productive projects, both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in AI.\nEconomist Herbert Simon and Allen Newell studied human problem-solving skills and attempted to formalize them, and their work laid the foundations of the field of artificial intelligence, as well as cognitive science, operations research and management science.\nThe regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating artificial intelligence (AI); it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms.\nBoth classifiers and regression learners can be viewed as \"function approximators\" trying to learn an unknown (possibly implicit) function; for example, a spam classifier can be viewed as learning a function that maps from the text of an email to one of two categories, \"spam\" or \"not spam\".\nIn contrast to computer hacking, software property issues, privacy issues and other topics normally ascribed to computer ethics, machine ethics is concerned with the behavior of machines towards human users and other machines.\nRobot designer Hans Moravec, cyberneticist Kevin Warwick, and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either.\nHumans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn't compete and would be superseded.In his book Superintelligence, philosopher Nick Bostrom provides an argument that artificial intelligence will pose a threat to humankind.\nIf this AI's goals do not fully reflect humanity's—one example is an AI told to compute as many digits of pi as possible—it might harm humanity in order to acquire more resources or prevent itself from being shut down, ultimately to better achieve its goal.\nModerate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal affect analysis (see multimodal sentiment analysis), wherein AI classifies the affects displayed by a videotaped subject.\nUnlike Simon and Newell, John McCarthy felt that machines did not need to simulate human thought, but should instead try to find the essence of abstract reasoning and problem-solving, regardless of whether people used the same algorithms.\nResearch in machine ethics is key to alleviating concerns with autonomous systems—it could be argued that the notion of autonomous machines without such a dimension is at the root of all fear concerning machine intelligence.\nAround 2016, China greatly accelerated its government funding; given its large supply of data and its rapidly increasing research output, some observers believe it may be on track to becoming an \"AI superpower\".\nI think the worry stems from a fundamental error in not distinguishing the difference between the very real recent advances in a particular aspect of AI and the enormity and complexity of building sentient volitional intelligence.\"\nBecause the capabilities of such an intelligence may be impossible to comprehend, the technological singularity is an occurrence beyond which events are unpredictable or even unfathomable.\n[g] Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field.\nLogic was also the focus of the work at the University of Edinburgh and elsewhere in Europe which led to the development of the programming language Prolog and the science of logic programming.\nThey need a way to visualize the future—a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it—and be able to make choices that maximize the utility (or \"value\") of available choices.\nArtificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1955, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an \"AI winter\"), followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding.\nOne high-profile example is that DeepMind in the 2010s developed a \"generalized artificial intelligence\" that could learn many diverse Atari games on its own, and later developed a variant of the system which succeeds at sequential learning.\nThis includes such works as Arthur C. Clarke's and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (both 1968), with HAL 9000, the murderous computer in charge of the Discovery One spaceship, as well as The Terminator (1984) and The Matrix (1999).\nSimilarly, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of how intelligent existing computer agents actually are.\nFaster computers, algorithmic improvements, and access to large amounts of data enabled advances in machine learning and perception; data-hungry deep learning methods started to dominate accuracy benchmarks around 2012.\nHe argues that sufficiently intelligent AI, if it chooses actions based on achieving some goal, will exhibit convergent behavior such as acquiring resources or protecting itself from being shut down.\nThis coincided with the development of the embodied mind thesis in the related field of cognitive science: the idea that aspects of the body (such as movement, perception and visualization) are required for higher intelligence.\nThe development of metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) very-large-scale integration (VLSI), in the form of complementary MOS (CMOS) transistor technology, enabled the development of practical artificial neural network (ANN) technology in the 1980s.\nThese algorithms proved to be insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experienced a \"combinatorial explosion\": they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger.\nAccording to Bloomberg's Jack Clark, 2015 was a landmark year for artificial intelligence, with the number of software projects that use AI within Google increased from a \"sporadic usage\" in 2012 to more than 2,700 projects.\nMachine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras (visible spectrum or infrared), microphones, wireless signals, and active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the world.\nEdward Fredkin argues that \"artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution\", an idea first proposed by Samuel Butler's \"Darwin among the Machines\" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by George Dyson in his book of the same name in 1998.\nScientists from the Future of Life Institute, among others, described some short-term research goals to see how AI influences the economy, the laws and ethics that are involved with AI and how to minimize AI security risks.\nThis issue, now known as \"robot rights\", is currently being considered by, for example, California's Institute for the Future, although many critics believe that the discussion is premature.\nA superintelligence, hyperintelligence, or superhuman intelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind.\nThe traditional problems (or goals) of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects.\n[a] Alternatively, an evolutionary system can induce goals by using a \"fitness function\" to mutate and preferentially replicate high-scoring AI systems, similar to how animals evolved to innately desire certain goals such as finding food.\n[c] Compared with humans, existing AI lacks several features of human \"commonsense reasoning\"; most notably, humans have powerful mechanisms for reasoning about \"naïve physics\" such as space, time, and physical interactions.\nSubjective estimates of the risk vary widely; for example, Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey estimate 47% of U.S. jobs are at \"high risk\" of potential automation, while an OECD report classifies only 9% of U.S. jobs as \"high risk\".\nA more elaborate definition characterizes AI as \"a system's ability to correctly interpret external data, to learn from such data, and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation.\"\nThe study of mathematical logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as \"0\" and \"1\", could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction.\nA modern mobile robot, when given a small, static, and visible environment, can easily determine its location and map its environment; however, dynamic environments, such as (in endoscopy) the interior of a patient's breathing body, pose a greater challenge.\n[f] A few of the most long-standing questions that have remained unanswered are these: should artificial intelligence simulate natural intelligence by studying psychology or neurobiology?\nHowever, around the 1990s, AI researchers adopted sophisticated mathematical tools, such as hidden Markov models (HMM), information theory, and normative Bayesian decision theory to compare or to unify competing architectures.\nComputer science defines AI research as the study of \"intelligent agents\": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.\nIn AGI research, some scholars caution against over-reliance on statistical learning, and argue that continuing research into GOFAI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence.\nResearchers from the related field of robotics, such as Rodney Brooks, rejected symbolic AI and focused on the basic engineering problems that would allow robots to move and survive.\n\"Keyword spotting\" strategies for search are popular and scalable but dumb; a search query for \"dog\" might only match documents with the literal word \"dog\" and miss a document with the word \"poodle\".\n'Strong' AI is usually labelled as artificial general intelligence (AGI) while attempts to emulate 'natural' intelligence have been called artificial biological intelligence (ABI).\nArtificial neural networks are an example of soft computing—they are solutions to problems which cannot be solved with complete logical certainty, and where an approximate solution is often sufficient.\nThe philosophical position that John Searle has named \"strong AI\" states: \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\nBy the 1980s, progress in symbolic AI seemed to stall and many believed that symbolic systems would never be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and pattern recognition.\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes AI will \"unlock a huge amount of positive things,\" such as curing disease and increasing the safety of autonomous cars.\nA February 2020 European Union white paper on artificial intelligence advocated for artificial intelligence for economic benefits, including \"improving healthcare (e.g.\nOther counterarguments revolve around humans being either intrinsically or convergently valuable from the perspective of an artificial intelligence.\nRegression is the attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change.\nSorayama never considered these organic robots to be real part of nature but always an unnatural product of the human mind, a fantasy existing in the mind even when realized in actual form.\nA problem like machine translation is considered \"AI-complete\", because all of these problems need to be solved simultaneously in order to reach human-level machine performance.\nFor Wallach, the question is not centered on the issue of whether machines can demonstrate the equivalent of moral behavior, unlike the constraints which society may place on the development of AMAs.\nZDNet reports, \"It presents something that did not actually occur,\" Though 88% of Americans believe Deepfakes can cause more harm than good, only 47% of them believe they can be targeted.\nAdvanced robotic arms and other industrial robots, widely used in modern factories, can learn from experience how to move efficiently despite the presence of friction and gear slippage.\nJobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy.\nColloquially, the term \"artificial intelligence\" is often used to describe machines that mimic \"cognitive\" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as \"learning\" and \"problem solving\".\nMachine learning (ML), a fundamental concept of AI research since the field's inception,[d] is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.\nHe attributes this to an increase in affordable neural networks, due to a rise in cloud computing infrastructure and to an increase in research tools and datasets.\nThis \"knowledge revolution\" led to the development and deployment of expert systems (introduced by Edward Feigenbaum), the first truly successful form of AI software.\nThe opinion of experts within the field of artificial intelligence is mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superhumanly-capable AI.\nWhen access to digital computers became possible in the mid-1950s, AI research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation.\n"
